# tts_shell
A short Python script that uses `speech-dispatcher` to speak terminal input and output. This program is not smart enough to handle a program like `vim`, which changes the position of the cursor (and has colorized output). It does, however, work well with `ed` and many other commands.

# Keyboard shortcuts
## Ctrl+A
Exit

## Ctrl+B
Toggle verbose mode.

## Ctrl+F
Increase speech rate.
